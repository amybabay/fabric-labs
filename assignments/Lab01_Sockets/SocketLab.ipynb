    "\n",
    "1. SSH into each node:\n",
    "    - Go to the [Experiments](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/experiments) page in the Fabric portal.\n",
    "    - Click on the \"telcom2310-fall23-babay\" project\n",
    "    - Click on \"Slices\" (on the lefthand side of the page)\n",
    "    - Click on the \"Lab01_Sockets\" slice. This should bring up a visual representation of your topology.\n",
    "    - For each node:\n",
    "        - Click on that node and copy the provided \"SSH Command\". This should be something like `ssh -F <path to SSH config file> -i <path to private sliver key> ubuntu@205.172.170.122`\n",
    "        - Open a terminal window (either on your local machine or in the JupyterHub) and enter the copied command, replacing `<path to SSH config file>` and `<path to private sliver key>` with the correct paths. For example, on JupyterHub, this would look like `ssh -F ~/work/fabric_config/ssh_config -i ~/work/fabric_config/fabric_sliver_key ubuntu@205.172.170.122`\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "In the terminal of each node, enter the command `ip addr`.\n",

    "### 2.2 Echo Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review the code for the `UDP_Echo_Client.py` and `UDP_Echo_Server.py` programs (we will do this together in class). Note that you can use your preferred text editor on your own computer to view copies downloaded from Canvas. Or you can view them on a remote Fabric node using the command `cat <filename>` (e.g. `cat UDP_Echo_Server.py`) to print the file contents to your terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the UDP_Echo_Server.py program on your GENI Node 1 using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 UDP_Echo_Server.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the UDP_Echo_Client.py program on your GENI Node 2 using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 UDP_Echo_Client.py -a <Node1_IP_Address>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `<Node1_IP_Address>` is replaced with the IP address of your Server Node found in the “Getting Started” section above\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be prompted to enter a message. Type in a word/sentence/phrase of your choice and hit enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UDP_Echo_Server.py` program running on your Server Node should receive the message, transform it to all UPPERCASE and echo it back to the client.\n",
    "**Copy and paste the output from your server and client into Lab1.docx**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the server will continue to wait for messages until it is manually killed. You can run the client as many times as you want (without stopping the server) and it should receive and echo the message back each time. To stop the server, use CTRL-C to kill the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1-3 above for `TCP_Echo_Server.py` and `TCP_Echo_Client.py`\n",
    "**Copy and paste the output from your server and client into Lab1.docx**\n"
